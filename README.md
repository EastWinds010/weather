# Welcome to WheatherApp!
## Flutter Version 2.10.3

Hi! the project **WheatherApp** was developed as a study and reference material for using APIs. The project fixed topics studied and provided me with great learning.

# Development Structure

The project followed a few steps:
• Prototyping using Figma
• HG Wheather API Documentation study
• Code development
• Testing


# HG Wheather API
The HG Wheather API is an api that returns data on current weather conditions in a city. in **WheaterAPP** the city location is obtained through geolocation.
